/**
 * This file is intended to help automate renaming of tokens.
 *
 * 1. Mark the old token's 'state' as deprecated
 * 2. Add a 'rename' attribute to the token with the value 'my.new.token'
 * 3. Create a new token matching the token above: 'my.new.token'
 * 4. Run 'yarn build tokens' to have you changes reflected in this map
 * 5. eslint and other tools will now use this to automate replacing tokens
 *
 * These changes will then be picked up by our tooling, which will attempt to
 * migrate as many of these renames as possible
