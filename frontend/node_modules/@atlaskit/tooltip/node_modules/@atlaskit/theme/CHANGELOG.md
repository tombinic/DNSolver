## 12.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`cf853e39278`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/cf853e39278) - **Breaking Changes:**

  - Package no longer has a peer dependency on `styled-components`. `styled-components` was used exclusively in
    `AtlaskitThemeProvider` and `Reset`. `Reset` has been removed (see below), while `AtlaskitThemeProvider` has been re-worked
    to remove the need for the dependency. To maintain compatibility we've provided a codemod to migrate usage.
  - `math` has been formally removed from the package. The usage of this package was already discouraged but for
    any remaining usages there is a codemod to migrate your code.
  - `Reset` has been removed. We want to lean more on the `@atlaskit/css-reset` as a canonical approach to resetting.
  - `Appearance` has been removed, this HOC component had no usage
  - `FLATTENED` has been removed, this constant had no usage

  **Housekeeping**:

  - Package no longer uses `exenv`
  - `Context` has been removed from the package; this component wasn't ever exported
  - Documentation and examples have been updated

  **Upgrading with codemod**

  You first need to have the latest version of `@atlaskit/theme` installed before you can run the codemod

  ```bash
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/theme@^12.0.0
  ```

  Then you can use our cli tool to run the codemod.

  ```bash
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
  ```

  This will automatically migrate `math` and the `AtlaskitThemeProvider` to the updated usage.

### Patch Changes

- [`cf853e39278`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/cf853e39278) - Fixes a bug where the AKThemeProvider could add multiple style elements on the same page if multiple instances of the component were supplied.
- [`cf853e39278`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/cf853e39278) - The `AtlaskitThemeProvider` has been reworked to be a functional component internally using hooks.
- [`cf853e39278`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/cf853e39278) - Add codemod for replacing `@atlaskit/theme/math` functions with simple binary JS expressions.
- Updated dependencies

- [`642a8a7735`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/642a8a7735) - [ux] `AtlaskitThemeProvider` (deprecated) applies a colour reset to anchor tags.

To go around specificity issues caused by `AtlaskitThemeProvider` in the past `@atlaskit/button` would apply a `!important` to it's `color` values. We have changed `AtlaskitThemeProvider` so that it will no longer impact the `color` values of `@atlaskit/button`

  ### Breaking

  ** getTokens props changes **
  When defining the value function passed into a ThemeProvider, the getTokens parameter cannot be called without props; if no props are provided an empty object `{}` must be passed in:

  ```javascript
  <CustomTheme.Provider
    value={t => ({ ...t(), backgroundColor: '#333'})}
  >
  ```

  becomes:

  ```javascript
  <CustomTheme.Provider
    value={t => ({ ...t({}), backgroundColor: '#333'})}
  >
  ```

  ** Color palette changes **
  Color palettes have been moved into their own file.
  Users will need to update imports from this:

  ```javascript
  import { colors } from '@atlaskit/theme';

  colors.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  to this:

  ```javascript
  import { colorPalette } from '@atlaskit/theme';

  colorPalette.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  or for multi entry-point users:

  ```javascript
  import * as colors from '@atlaskit/theme/colors';

  colors.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  to this:

  ```javascript
  import * as colorPalettes from '@atlaskit/theme/color-palette';

  colorPalettes.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.
