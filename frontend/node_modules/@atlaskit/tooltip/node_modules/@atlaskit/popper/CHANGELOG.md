  to prevent duplicates of tslib being bundled.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`044869b067`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/044869b067) - This major release of Popper upgrades from react-popper v.1.3.6 to 2.2.3, which includes version 2 of Popper JS (@popperjs/core). This is a complete re-write of popper.js which comes with bundle-size and performance improvements, as well as a number of bug fixes and longer-term support.

  There are a number of major changes for consumers are listed below; ⚙️ indicates the change has codemod support:

  - **Component Props**:
    - ⚙️ `offset` is no longer a string, but an array of two integers (i.e. '0px 8px' is now [0, 8])
  - **Render Props**:
    - ⚙️ `outOfBoundaries` has been replaced with `isReferenceHidden`, and is now true when the popper is hidden (i.e. by a
      scroll container)
    - ⚙️ `scheduleUpdate`, for async updates, has been renamed to `update`, and now returns a Promise.
    - **✨new** `hasPopperEscaped` tracks when the reference element is fully clipped or hidden
    - **✨new** `forceUpdate` is exposed to perform synchronous updates
  - **Types**:
    - @atlaskit/popper now exports a number of useful types from both `@popperjs/core` (`Placement`) and `react-popper`
      (`ManagerProps`, `ReferenceProps`, `PopperProps`, `PopperArrowProps`, `PopperChildrenProps`, `StrictModifier`,
      `Modifier`).
    - Custom modifiers are now more strongly typed; to improve the specificity of the types, pass a generic type with
      the modifier names you plan to use.
  - **Custom modifiers**:
    This only affects users applying custom modifiers via the `modifiers` prop:
  - the `modifiers` prop has been significantly updated:
  - The format is now an array of objects, each labelled via a `name` key:value pair. Previously the prop
    was an object where each property was the modifier name.
  - Prop options are grouped together in an `options` object
  - default boundary paddings have been removed from `preventOverflow` and `flip`; to restore original
    padding, set `padding: 5`
  - modifiers that supported a `boundariesElement` option now have two options in its place:
    - `boundary`, which takes `clippingParents` (similar to `scrollParent`)
    - `rootBoundary` which takes `viewport` or `document` (replacing `viewport` and `window`respectively)

  Each modifier has more internal changes not listed here: see [the Popper JS docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/) for more information, as well as the [Popper migration guide](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/migration-guide/) for an example of the new list structure.

  Due to the highly specific nature of these modifiers, codemod support is not provided for this change

  Note: due to a bug in `react-popper`, a console.error message relating to React `act()` may be raised on some tests. It should not cause test failures. This issue has been raised in [the React Popper issue tracker](https://github.com/popperjs/react-popper/issues/368)

  **Running the codemod cli**

  To run the codemod: **You first need to have the latest version of popper installed before you can run the codemod**

  `yarn upgrade @atlaskit/popper@^5.0.0`

  Once upgraded, use the Atlaskit codemod-cli;

  `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli --parser [PARSER] --extensions [FILE_EXTENSIONS] [TARGET_PATH]`

  Or run `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli -h` for more details on usage.
  For Atlassians, refer to [this doc](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/framework/atlassian-frontend/codemods/01-atlassian-codemods/) for more details on the codemod CLI.

- [minor][76299208e6](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/76299208e6):

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.
