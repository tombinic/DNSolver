    - `AnalyticsContextConsumer`
    - `withAnalyticsHook`
    - `usePatchedProps`
    - `cleanProps`
    - `AnalyticsReactContext`
    - `AnalyticsEventMap`

  ### Improvements

  - Optimization of components to prevent unnecessary re-renders via inline callbacks or jsons
  - Conversion to Function Components where possible
  - Preparation for dropping legacy React context in a future major release (see note below)
  - Documentation improvements
  - Improved directory structure
  - Adoption of new standards

  ### IMPORTANT: Note on React Context changes

  (Legacy React context)[https://reactjs.org/docs/legacy-context.html] will be removed in a future version of React.

  In addition its presence can be (problematic for performance)[https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1064559184010723330].

  As a result, we have taken steps to migrate away from it and use the new (React Context API)[https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html].

  To achieve this we are rolling the drop out in 2 phases:

  #### Phase I (this release)

  We have changed analytics components to receive modern context. Listeners and the Context layer will provide both modern and legacy context by default.

  At their own risk, package consumers can opt in to no longer supply legacy context by using the environment variable
  ANALYTICS_NEXT_MODERN_CONTEXT=true.

  When doing so, any analytics consumers that rely on legacy context will not receive any, and events may be lost! This would happen when using old atlaskit packages that consume a version of @atlaskit/analytics-next before this version.

  #### Phase II (future major)

  In a future release (TBA) we will remove all legacy context support and clean up the branching around ANALYTICS_NEXT_MODERN_CONTEXT.
  After this point, @atlaskit/analytics-next will not work with components that use a version prior to this one.

## 5.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [minor][e1f8aaf33b](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/e1f8aaf33b):

  - Adding entry point for `AnalyticsErrorBoundary` package

  ```
  // How to use

  // Import via entry point
  import AnalyticsListener from '@atlaskit/analytics-next/AnalyticsListener';
  import AnalyticsErrorBoundary from '@atlaskit/analytics-next/AnalyticsErrorBoundary';

  // Wrapping your component with the component
  class ButtonWithAnalyticsErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
    handleEvent = (analyticsEvent) => {
      const { payload, context } = analyticsEvent;
      console.log('Received event:', analyticsEvent, { payload, context });
    };

    render() {
      return (
        <AnalyticsListener channel="atlaskit" onEvent={this.handleEvent}>
          <AnalyticsErrorBoundary
            channel="atlaskit"
            data={{
              componentName: 'button',
              packageName: '@atlaskit/button',
              componentVersion: '999.9.9',
            }}
          >
            <Button>Click me</Button>
          </AnalyticsErrorBoundary>
        </AnalyticsListener>
      )
    }
  }
  ```

  Notes on new API:

  - Plug-and-play component. As soon and it's wrapping a component it's fully integrated.
  - It has Analytics context and events integrated already. Keep in mind it requires `AnalyticsListener` as a top level component to work properly, otherwise it won't trigger analytics events.

- [major][76299208e6](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/76299208e6):

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.

## 3.1.0

- [minor][cffeed0](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/cffeed0):

  - Type `withAnalyticsEvents` and `withAnalyticsContext` HOCs so that they do not lose flow types of the components they wrap when chained together.

    This will fix flow types not flowing through all of the components that we have instrumented with analytics as they are typically wrapped with both HOCs. To get flow types flowing
    through your components again, upgrade them to the latest version and also update their @atlaskit/analytics-next dependency to the latest version.

    We also now export `AnalyticsContextWrappedComp` and `AnalyticsEventsWrappedComp` parameterised types that allow you to explicitly type components wrapped with these HOCs which is necessary in cases where the HOC wrapping is extracted into another function.
