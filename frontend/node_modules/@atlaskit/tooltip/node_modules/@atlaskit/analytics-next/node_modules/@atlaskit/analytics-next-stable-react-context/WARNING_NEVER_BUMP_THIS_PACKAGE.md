## Why

Bumping this package would cause multiple versions of this package to exist.

In the situation where duplicate copies of this package is bundled into a product, it results in the context
being instantiated multiple times, with some components having one reference and others another.

The AnalyticsListener component only provides context to one of these references, meaning that the other
components wonâ€™t have a registered handler.

Their events when fired go no where and are lost.
