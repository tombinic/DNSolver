# Analytics-Next Stable React Context

One single react context to support multiple versions of analytics-next that share the one single context reference.

THIS PACKAGE SHOULD NEVER BE UPDATED - see [here][neverbump].

yarn add @atlaskit/analytics-next-stable-react-context
```

## Usage

Generally speaking, only `@atlaskit/analytics-next` should use this directly.
